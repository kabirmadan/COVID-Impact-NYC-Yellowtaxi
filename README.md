# Taxis of NYC
### EG10118 Final Project

#### About the project
The goal of this project was to visualize the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the usage of yellow taxis in New York City. We did this by parsing large quantities of publicly accessible CSV data from 2019 and 2020, and comparing the two years. We used Bootstrap to create the final website.

#### Downloading the data
We restructured the data so that it is no longer a large download. All of it is stored in the “data” folder in 13 csv files, and these are the ones that are uploaded to the Colab runtime for each visualization.
